Name
  qhull -- convex hull and Delaunay triangulation
  rbox -- generate point distributions

Purpose
  The files in this directory are part of qhull-software. The
  directory contains two programs, qhull and rbox. qhull is a general
  dimension convex hull program that reads a set of points from stdin,
  and outputs the smallest convex set that contains the points to
  stdout according to printout options.  rbox is a useful tool in
  generating input for qhull; it generates a random array of points.

Environment requirements
  qhull and rbox run on all Unix machines. ANSI-C compiler is needed to 
  compile the files. The software is self-contained.  qhull is copyrighted 
  software.  Please read the file COPYING.
