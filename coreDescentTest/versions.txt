> coreDescentTest.cpp

From a core obtained by particleGrowthMD (v3D), grow the region by going down strictly the distance map.


> localGenMaximum.cpp

Use local maximum of the growth generation (region growth from the surface toward inside) to extract cores.

> makeGraphStructure.cpp

Construct a tree from the growth order (captured in ascendents and descendents).

> makeGraphStructureV2.cpp
Try to prune some spurious medial axis points via 'linear separability'.

> makeGraphStructureV3.cpp
Try to reproduce what makeGraphStructureV2 gives with distance map transform.

> makeGraphStructureV4.cpp
It also partition the particles from the MST and its weakest links.

> makeGraphStructureV5.cpp
It uses 4-neibor for propagation (as before) and 8-neighbor for linking those within the same generation.

> makeGraphStructureV6.cpp
Define medial core as one whose collection of descendents will split the surface into two.
