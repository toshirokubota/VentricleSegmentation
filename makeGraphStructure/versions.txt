A core is strong if removing its surface descendents results in spliting the surface into two (or more).

> makeGraphStructureV2.cpp

Back more or less to an older more computationally lighter way - a core is strong if there is no descendent
prior to more aggressive (descents) implemented propagateDescendency and propagateDescendency2.

> makeGraphStructureV3.cpp
When src and sink points are given by the user, it first constructs a shortest path tree, and use it
(instead of minimum spannig tree) to segment the volume.
There are still branches that spans out of a ventricle (especially the right one)...
